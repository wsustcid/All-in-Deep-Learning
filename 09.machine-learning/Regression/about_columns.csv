Description, Brief description of the model
Prevents Overfitting, Model easily tuned to prevent overfitting
Handles Outliers, Model intended to handle outliers
Handles Several Features, Model effectively handles large numbers of features
Adaptive Regularization, Model adaptive learns regularization terms during training
Large Dataset, Model computationally efficient on very large datasets (>100000 samples)
Nonlinear, Base model fits well to nonlinear data (linear models can also fit nonlinear data but takes some tuning)
Interpretability Score, From 5 (highly interpretable) - 1 (not interpretable). Theses really no science behind the score given; more of just my best judgement.
